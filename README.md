# Project 4 - *BlueSkyTweets*

**BlueSkyTweets** is an android app that allows a user to view home and mentions timelines, view user profiles with user timelines, as well as compose and post a new tweet. The app utilizes [Twitter REST API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public).

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [X] The app includes **all required user stories** from Week 3 Twitter Client
* [X] User can **switch between Timeline and Mention views using tabs**
  * [X] User can view their home timeline tweets.
  * [X] User can view the recent mentions of their username.
* [X] User can navigate to **view their own profile**
  * [X] User can see picture, tagline, # of followers, # of following, and tweets on their profile.
* [X] User can **click on the profile image** in any tweet to see **another user's** profile.
 * [X] User can see picture, tagline, # of followers, # of following, and tweets of clicked user.
 * [X] Profile view includes that user's timeline
* [X] User can [infinitely paginate](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Endless-Scrolling-with-AdapterViews-and-RecyclerView) any of these timelines (home, mentions, user) by scrolling to the bottom

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] Implements robust error handling, [check if internet is available](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Sending-and-Managing-Network-Requests#checking-for-network-connectivity), handle error cases, network failures
* [X] When a network request is sent, user sees an [indeterminate progress indicator](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Handling-ProgressBars#progress-within-actionbar)

The following **bonus** features are implemented:

* [X] Use Parcelable instead of Serializable using the popular [Parceler library](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-Parceler).

* [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality:

   Automatic retries with infinite scrolling -- a total of 3 retries. Also if the user is offline,
the app retries every 10 seconds to re-connect. The User and Tweet objects are Parcelables rather
than Serializables.
